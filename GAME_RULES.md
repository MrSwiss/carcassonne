# Carcassonne

In Carcassonne players lay out tiles one at a time to create a board. Each player has a limited number of followers(meeples) they place on the board to get points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.

##Setup

The tiles are shuffled and placed in a stack. The starting tile is placed in the center of the grid. Each player picks a color of meeple they wish to have. 

##Turn

During a player's turn they are going to draw a tile and place it on the board. Valid positioning requires a like edge must align with a like edge(cities connect with cities etc.). The goal is to place the tiles so that you can complete cities/roads/cloisters/fields. In order to score points, you must have one of your pieces on that complete block of map. A player scores as many points as there are tiles that make up the city x2(two tiles means 4 points). If the tile has a blue shield on it, the player scores an extra two points. 

A city is not the only completed landmass that will give you points.

Cities are complete when there walls are enclosed, they are worth 2 points per tile.
Roads are complete when there are two endpoints, roads are worth 1 point.
Cloisters are complete when there are tiles that completely surround it. 1 point per tile.

##Farms

Farms are never complete, when you create a farmer you keep it in one place for the entirety of the game in a green area. You place a farmer and for as long as there is a green expanse, players are not allowed to place a unit on the farmer's land. At the end of the game, the farmer gets 3 points for every completed city his farm is near. 

## Order of play 

Every turn consists of three steps:
1. You draw a tile and place it on the table. If the tile has no place to go you draw again.
2. If you have followers, place a follower on the board.
3. Calculate the current points gained by this turn. 


You can not put a follower down on a completed city if another player already has claimed it. In the case where you put down a farmer on an unclaimed green tile, and later on the board is expanded so that two farmers lay claim to the same farm, it is ok and both players will receive points at the end of the game.
